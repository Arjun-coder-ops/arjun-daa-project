## Project Description
The **Library Book Finder** is a web-based project built using **Python** and **Streamlit**.  
It allows users to search for books in a library efficiently using the **Binary Search algorithm**.  
The project features a visually appealing web interface, interactive search inputs, and instant feedback for users.

## Algorithm Used

### Binary Search
Binary Search is an efficient algorithm to find an element in a **sorted list**.  
The list is repeatedly divided in half, comparing the middle element with the target value.  
- If the middle element is the target, the search ends.  
- Otherwise, the search continues in the left or right half until the target is found or the list ends.

**Pseudocode:**
```text
function binary_search(array, target):
    left = 0
    right = length(array) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if array[mid] == target:
            return mid
        else if array[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1

This is a **single Markdown file** (`README.md`) that you can push to GitHub.  

If you want, I can also **add a section for “Screenshots of your actual app”** so it looks even more professional for your submission.  

Do you want me to do that?
