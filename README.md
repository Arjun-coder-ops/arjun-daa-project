# 📚 Library Book Finder using Binary Search

## 📌 Project Idea
This project implements a **Library Book Finder** using the **Binary Search Algorithm**.  
Given a list of books sorted alphabetically, the program allows a user to **search for a book by name**.  
If found, it returns the position of the book in the library list; otherwise, it reports that the book is not available.  

This project demonstrates the use of **Searching Algorithms** in solving real-world problems efficiently.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The library book list is already sorted alphabetically.  
2. The user enters the book name to search.  
3. **Binary Search** is used to find the book:
   - Compare the target book with the middle element.
   - If equal → book is found.
   - If smaller → search the left half.
   - If larger → search the right half.
4. Continue until the book is found or search space is empty.

## ✨ Features
- Implements **Binary Search from scratch** (no libraries used).  
- User-friendly (interactive input).  
- Works on **any sorted dataset** (can be book names, roll numbers, product IDs).  
- Demonstrates practical application of searching algorithms.  
- Includes a **step-by-step ASCII visualization** for clarity.
